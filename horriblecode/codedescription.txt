Good Code
In code.py, I used good coding principles.
I used KISS by keeping the functions as simple as possible.
I used DRY code, by not repeating any code in the file
I used Single Responsibility, as each function is expected to do only one thing.

Bad Code
In horriblecode.py, I didn't handle exceptions given that a value was divided by 0.
I used repetitive code when it was asking for inputs, instead of abstracting it
The main function is doing too much, as its displaying the menu, handling input,
performing and printing results. All of which should've been abstracted to their
own functions.
